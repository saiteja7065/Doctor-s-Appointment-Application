```bash
# Navigate to the medme-app directory
cd "e:\FULL STACK\Doctor Appointment Application\medme-app"

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="mongodb|doctors/apply|doctors/search"
```

## 📊 Test Results

After running the tests, you can document the results using the provided template:

1. Copy the `TEST_RESULTS_TEMPLATE.md` file
2. Fill in the test results
3. Save the file with a date stamp, e.g., `TEST_RESULTS_2025_01_21.md`

## 🔄 What's Being Tested

The tests cover the following functionalities:

1. **Health Check**: Tests if the API is running
2. **MongoDB Connection**: Tests if the database connection is working
3. **Doctor Application**: Tests the doctor application submission process
4. **Doctor Search**: Tests the doctor search functionality
5. **Admin Overview**: Tests the admin statistics endpoint
6. **Notifications**: Tests the notification system
7. **Error Handling**: Tests how the application handles errors

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while running the tests:

1. **API Connection Issues**:
   - Make sure the application is running on port 3000
   - Check if there are any CORS issues

2. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Verify MongoDB is running
   - Check the connection string in the environment variables

3. **Authentication Issues**:
   - The tests use demo mode, which bypasses authentication
   - If testing with real authentication, make sure you have valid credentials

4. **Test Script Issues**:
   - Make sure you have the required dependencies installed
   - Check for any syntax errors in the test scripts

## 📝 Reporting Issues

If you find any issues during testing:

1. Document the issue in detail
2. Include steps to reproduce
3. Include expected vs. actual behavior
4. Include any error messages or screenshots
5. Add the issue to the "Issues Found" section of the test results

## 🚀 Next Steps

After testing:

1. Fix any identified issues
2. Update the test scripts as needed
3. Re-run the tests to verify the fixes
4. Document the results
